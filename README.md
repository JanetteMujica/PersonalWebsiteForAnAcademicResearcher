## Creation process

In the links below, I share early wireframes of the project. Thereafter, I went through an iterative process. I consulted my teacher, classmates, and client. Their feedback guided my design decisions. 

For example, I changed the hamburger menu for a simpler, visible, and straightforward menu system that makes the structure of the website much clearer. It also led me to reorganise the welcome page and bring forward the client main message around his research orientation and carreer objective.
